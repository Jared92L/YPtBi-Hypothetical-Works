# Define a function to handle experimental data related to YPtBi
def yptbi_experiment_data(experiment_type, outcomes, costs, energy_requirements, time_estimates, links, hypotheses, references):
    """
    This function accepts experiment data and stores it for later reference in open-source research.
    
    Parameters:
    - experiment_type (str): The type of experiment being conducted (e.g., QCPs, quantum oscillations).
    - outcomes (list): Possible favorable and unfavorable outcomes.
    - costs (dict): Estimated costs for the experiment (equipment, time, labor).
    - energy_requirements (str): Energy requirements for the experiment (low, medium, high).
    - time_estimates (str): Time required for the experiment (short, medium, long).
    - links (list): Links to ongoing experiments and research articles.
    - hypotheses (dict): Hypothetical connections (e.g., between YPtBi and string theory).
    - references (list): List of references (journal articles, papers, books, etc.) related to the theoretical concepts and experimental works.

    Returns:
    - str: A confirmation message that the experiment data has been stored successfully.
